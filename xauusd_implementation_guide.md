## 🎯 TRADING STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

### **Core Strategy: Psychological Level Confluence**

#### **Entry Criteria (ALL Must Be Met)**
1. **Primary:** Price approaching major psychological level
   - Round numbers: $2000, $2050, $2100, $2150, etc.
   - Half-levels: $2025, $2075, $2125, etc.

2. **Confirmation:** Clear level test setup
   - Previous bounces from same level (historical respect)
   - Approaching level for 2nd+ time
   - Clear rejection candle formation

3. **Timing:** Optimal session overlap
   - London-NY overlap preferred (13:00-16:00 UTC)
   - London session acceptable (08:00-16:00 UTC)

4. **Risk Management Ready**
   - Stop loss placement determined
   - Position size calculated
   - Target profit level identified

#### **Entry Types**

**Type 1: Support Bounce**
- Price approaches support level from above
- Shows rejection (long wick, doji, hammer)
- Enter LONG on next candle if bullish close

**Type 2: Resistance Rejection**
- Price approaches resistance from below
- Shows rejection (long upper wick, shooting star)
- Enter SHORT on next candle if bearish close

**Type 3: Breakout Retest** (Lower probability due to 2% false breakout rate)
- Price breaks through level with volume
- Retraces to test level as new support/resistance
- Enter in direction of breakout if level holds

### **Position Sizing Formula**
```
Position Size = (Account Size × Risk%) ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)

Example:
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 2%
- Entry: $2050
- Stop: $2030
- Risk Amount: $200
- Price Difference: $20
- Position Size: $200 ÷ $20 = 10 mini lots (0.1 standard lot)
```

### **Stop Loss Placement**
- **Support Trades:** 15-25 pips below support level
- **Resistance Trades:** 15-25 pips above resistance level
- **Breakout Trades:** Other side of broken level + 10 pips

### **Take Profit Targets**
- **Conservative:** 1:2 risk/reward minimum
- **Aggressive:** Next major psychological level
- **Trail:** Move stop to breakeven after 1:1, trail at 1:1.5
